# Dotfiles

Unlike other dotfiles setups which symlink a bunch of files from `~/your/dotfiles/repo` to `~`, the approach of this repo is to simply use your home directory as a dotfiles git repository and use a crazy-long `.gitignore` file to avoid all the non-dotfile content in your home directory. Could be crazy, but it's working so far.
