# Dotfiles

Unlike other dotfiles setups which symlink a bunch of files from `~/your/dotfiles/repo` to `~`, this repo simply uses your home directory as a dotfiles git repository and uses a crazy-long `.gitignore` file to avoid all the non-dotfile content in your home directory. It's crazy, but it works.
