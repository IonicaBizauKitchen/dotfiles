Cheap except when you want custom SSL, then you have to be prepared to pay up ($600).\n\nCloudFlare: Easy, flexible, but not that fast and somewhat unreliable. Nice if you want a cloud-based reverse proxy. Page rules are really powerful.\n\nMaxCDN: Cheap, delivers both in terms of availability and performance. Unfortunately a somewhat buggy front-end and API. But their fast support makes up for all of that.\n\nhttps://github.com/niftylettuce/express-cdn\nhttp://documentup.com/niftylettuce/express-cdn\n\nhttp://aws.typepad.com/aws/2014/03/server-name-indication-sni-and-http-redirection-for-amazon-cloudfront.html\n\n## Quotes\n\n> Advent of BaaS - The obvious question with building front-end applications is where does the state live? Fortunately there are many services solving this problem. Parse, Firebase, Kinvey, to name a few. Even Dropbox has entered the space with their Datastore API. We also have open-source initiatives such as Hood.ie, TogetherJS, and Helios which all look promising. The most astonishing thing is how incredibly powerful these services are. MVPs will be shipping faster than ever.\n\n> The next generation of developers are cutting their teeth on these front-end JavaScript and CSS frameworks and they are using Backend Services to flesh out their ideas. They don't care about LAMP, Ruby on Rails, or ExpressJS. These choices simply don't matter like they used to. The focus now is almost entirely the client.\n\n> I’d dare say even those learning Ruby on Rails are behind. Raking Active Records was nice in the pre-NoSQL days but these days you either want finely crafted DB queries with absolute control (node + MariaDB/PostgreSQL/DataWarehouse) or you don’t want an SQL database (MEAN) — if you even need a database at all. The HTML5 data attribute alone has made working with small amounts of data much more elegant.\n","markers":{"markers":{"1":{"id":1,"range":[[30,0],[30,0]],"tailed":false,"reversed":false,"valid":true,"invalidate":"never","persistent":true,"properties":{"type":"selection","editorId":12,"goalBufferRange":null},"deserializer":"Marker"}},"deserializer":"MarkerManager"},"history":{"undoStack":[{"patches":[{"oldRange":[[29,0],[29,0]],"newRange":[[29,0],[30,0]],"oldText":"","newText":"\n","normalizeLineEndings":{},"markerPatches":{},"deserializer":"BufferPatch"},{"oldRange":[[30,0],[30,0]],"newRange":[[30,0],[30,0]],"oldText":"","newText":"","normalizeLineEndings":true,"markerPatches":{},"deserializer":"BufferPatch"}],"deserializer":"Transaction"},{"patches":[{"oldRange":[[30,0],[30,0]],"newRange":[[30,0],[30,74]],"oldText":"","newText":"https://www.firebase.com/blog/2014-05-13-introducing-firebase-hosting.html","normalizeLineEndings":{},"markerPatches":{},"deserializer":"BufferPatch"}],"deserializer":"Transaction"},{"patches":[{"oldRange":[[30,0],[30,0]],"newRange":[[30,0],[30,1]],"oldText":"","newText":"-","normalizeLineEndings":{},"markerPatches":{},"deserializer":"BufferPatch"}],"deserializer":"Transaction"},{"patches":[{"oldRange":[[30,1],[30,1]],"newRange":[[30,1],[30,2]],"oldText":"","newText":" ","normalizeLineEndings":{},"markerPatches":{},"deserializer":"BufferPatch"}],"deserializer":"Transaction"},{"patches":[{"oldRange":[[30,2],[30,2]],"newRange":[[30,2],[30,3]],"oldText":"","newText":"[","normalizeLineEndings":{},"markerPatches":{},"deserializer":"BufferPatch"}],"deserializer":"Transaction"},{"patches":[{"oldRange":[[30,3],[30,3]],"newRange":[[30,3],[30,31]],"oldText":"","newText":"Introducing Firebase Hosting","normalizeLineEndings":{},"markerPatches":{},"deserializer":"BufferPatch"}],"deserializer":"Transaction"},{"patches":[{"oldRange":[[30,31],[30,31]],"newRange":[[30,31],[30,32]],"oldText":"","newText":"]","normalizeLineEndings":{},"markerPatches":{},"deserializer":"BufferPatch"}],"deserializer":"Transaction"},{"patches":[{"id":1,"oldParams":{"tailed":true,"range":[[30,32],[30,106]]},"newParams":{"tailed":false,"range":[[30,106],[30,106]]},"deserializer":"MarkerPatch"},{"oldRange":[[30,32],[30,106]],"newRange":[[30,32],[30,108]],"oldText":"https://www.firebase.com/blog/2014-05-13-introducing-firebase-hosting.html","newText":"(https://www.firebase.com/blog/2014-05-13-introducing-firebase-hosting.html)","normalizeLineEndings":{},"markerPatches":{},"deserializer":"BufferPatch"},{"id":1,"oldParams":{"tailed":false},"newParams":{"tailed":true},"deserializer":"MarkerPatch"},{"id":1,"oldParams":{"range":[[30,108],[30,108]]},"newParams":{"range":[[30,33],[30,107]]},"deserializer":"MarkerPatch"}],"deserializer":"Transaction"}],"redoStack":[],"deserializer":"History"},"filePath":"/Users/zeke/code/hero/static/README.md","modifiedWhenLastPersisted":false,"digestWhenLastPersisted":"8846d6f583ea8cf3f83258594b6e9aec92776022","deserializer":"TextBuffer"}],"deserializer":"Project"},"workspace":{"paneContainer":{"root":{"items":[{"id":12,"softTabs":true,"displayBuffer":{"id":13,"softWrap":false,"editorWidthInChars":121,"scrollTop":9,"scrollLeft":0,"tokenizedBuffer":{"bufferPath":"/Users/zeke/code/hero/static/README.md","tabLength":2,"deserializer":"TokenizedBuffer"},"deserializer":"DisplayBuffer"},"deserializer":"Editor"}],"activeItemUri":"/Users/zeke/code/hero/static/README.md","focused":true,"active":true,"deserializer":"Pane"},"deserializer":"PaneContainer"},"fullScreen":false,"deserializer":"Workspace"},"packageStates":{"fuzzy-finder":{"/Users/zeke/code/hero/static/README.md":1400007849351},"keybinding-resolver":{"attached":false},"metrics":{"sessionLength":12364251},"tree-view":{"directoryExpansionStates":{},"selectedPath":"/Users/zeke/code/hero/static/README.md","hasFocus":false,"attached":true,"scrollLeft":0,"scrollTop":0,"width":200}}}
