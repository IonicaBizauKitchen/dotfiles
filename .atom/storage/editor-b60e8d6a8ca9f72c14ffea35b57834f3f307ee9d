Namely we need to create a `compiled_billable_units`\ntable since all of our SQL functions depend on this table and its columns.\n\nThe table creation is defined in the test_helper and is called upon each test\nrun.\n\n```\n$ export $(cat .env)\n$ bundle exec turn test/\n```\n\n","markers":{"markers":{"1":{"id":1,"range":[[0,0],[4,0]],"tailed":true,"reversed":false,"valid":true,"invalidate":"never","persistent":true,"properties":{"type":"selection","editorId":28,"goalBufferRange":null},"deserializer":"Marker"}},"deserializer":"MarkerManager"},"history":{"undoStack":[{"patches":[{"oldRange":[[3,0],[3,0]],"newRange":[[3,0],[4,0]],"oldText":"","newText":"by [The Vault 2.0](https://github.com/heroku/vault_docs).
