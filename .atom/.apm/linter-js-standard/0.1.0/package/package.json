If Linter is not installed, please follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/AtomLinter/Linter).\n\n### Plugin installation\n```\n$ apm install linter-js-standard\n```\n\n## Known issues\n\n### OSX\nIf you have your environment variables in `.bash_profile` or `.bashrc` like me and you launch Atom from the GUI it doesn't load environment variables, unless you launch it from the terminal. This is a known [issue](https://github.com/atom/atom-shell/issues/550).\n\nA workaround for this issue is to edit Atom init script and set \"dynamically\" `$PATH` variable.\nTo do so go: `Atom` -> `Open Your Init Script` and paste the following code:\n\n```coffeescript\nsys = require('sys')\nexec = require('child_process').exec;\n\nexec \"source ~/.bash_profile && echo $PATH\", (err, stdout) ->\n  process.env.PATH = stdout.replace '\\n', ''\n```\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/ricardofbarros/linter-js-standard/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/ricardofbarros/linter-js-standard","_id":"linter-js-standard@0.1.0","_shasum":"102385b3d073939dcfd613c32b4c4b8605df8659","_resolved":"file:../d-115229-30615-1dwkz9l/package.tgz","_from":"../d-115229-30615-1dwkz9l/package.tgz"}
